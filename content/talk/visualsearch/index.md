summary: Presenting recent developments in a theory of visual search. Recent developments of the theory take into account the foveate nature of the visual system, the masking properties of natural scenes on target detectability and selects a location that is optimal given these limitations. There is also some experimental work that shows how the predictions from the theory square up against human visual search.
