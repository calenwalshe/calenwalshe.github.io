A talk is planned at the Molatov Seminar series on Friday, October 12, 2018. The Molatov Seminars is described by its organizers as: "Molotov Seminar hosts talks at UT by anyone, for anyone, on anything."

I plan to do just that and will discuss economic inequality from a statistical perspective. A topic I don't work on professionally but am very interested. I hope to stimulate a good discussion at the least.
